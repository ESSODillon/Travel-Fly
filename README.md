# Travel-Fly
The final project for my Web Dev summer course of 2019. 
This project shows an intermediate understanding of HTML and CSS layouts. It was the first time I implemented responsiveness into a website, which was super cool to see on my phone. SCSS was also very interesting to learn, and made me appreciate the usability and time saving features. Understand I was a Freshman in college when I created this, so it's pretty simple. 15 pages total
